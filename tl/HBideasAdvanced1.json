  "eraFooterTextObj": {
    "Polytheism": "<p><b>Polytheism</b> (the worship of multiple gods) was the practice of every Ancient Near East civilization.  According to Kaufmann, the multiple gods of polytheism inhabit (literally) a metadivine realm which existed before their birth and which contains forces and powers to which the gods are subject (for example, the Greek gods were subject to, and could not escape, fate).  As a direct logical consequence, the gods are limited in their power: they can be frustrated by the rules of the metadivine realm within which they operate, or perhaps by the contrary will of another more powerful god.  Because in the usual mythologies of polytheism the &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; of the metadivine realm is the source of everything (gods, people, animals, nature), it’s common to have a fluid boundary between these spheres.  This fluidity promotes the notion of a god as a personification of some aspect of nature (e.g., fire, water), the occasional sexual union between gods and humans, and the idea of apotheosis: a human becoming a god, after death or upon ascending a throne.  In such a system where it’s the stuff of the metadivine realm that contains the ultimate power, magicians and diviners manipulate that stuff in order to coerce the gods or to determine the future (which is in no ultimate sense determined by the will of the gods).  Significantly, Kaufmann holds that in polytheism, both good and bad are generated from the metadivine realm and the evil forces are understood to be autonomous, independent of the good gods.  (This autonomy is reflected in later cosmic dualism, with one god and one evil force.)  The salvation of humans is their own problem and achieved, if at all, through magic or gnosticism (secret knowledge which liberates one from the usual rules).</p><p>The Bible contains much evidence that at the turn of the first millenium BCE, the Israelites were polytheists:  1) the principal example: the golden calf incident in Exodus 32 (bull/calf worship was common in Egypt and elsewhere);  2) the First Commandment (&quot;You shall have no other gods before me.&quot;)</p>",

    "Monolatry": "<p><b>Monolatry</b> (the worship of a single god while acknowledging (or at least not denying) the existence of others) is just a stronger version of the notion within polytheism of local gods with whom the populace has a special relationship.  And indeed the fundamental Israelite notion of covenant has been shown to parallel the common ancient near eastern practice of suzerainty contracts.  In such a contract, the superior party (the suzerain) provides the terms of a relationship contract, for example, a land grant, in exchange for some behavior, and the inferior party (the vassal) obeys.  The reciprocal Mosaic covenant at Sinai in which Yahweh promises to protect and bless Israel and the people promise to obey the law and commandments revealed to Moses is a typical suzerainty contract.</p><p>Perhaps the classic articulation of Israelite monolatry is the first Commandment: &quot;You shall have no other gods before me.&quot;  [It's not necessary to prohibit what's impossible.]</p>",

    "Exile": "<p>The destruction of the Jerusalem temple and the <b>Exile</b> to Babylon in 587 BCE (in some textbooks 586 BCE) signaled the end of Judaean monarchy and political independence; subsequent Jewish history would unfold (except for the eighty years of Hasmonean independence, 140s BCE to 63 BCE) under the suzerainty of foreign empires.  The rebuilt temple could never quite claim the same glory or authority as the one that had been built by King Solomon, but it would serve nonetheless as the central institution of the Judaean polity until its destruction in 70 CE.  The two temple destructions (587 BCE and 70 CE) would come to represent in Judaism the problem of evil: why would God allow his house to be destroyed and his people to be exiled?</p>",

    "Monotheism / Cosmic Monism": "<p>The common term <b>monotheism</b> is insufficiently precise for our purposes.  What we mean here is the belief that there is but a single cosmic power. It follows inescapably that whatever happens occurs as the result of that cosmic power.  So, to describe this belief we use the term <b>cosmic monism</b> because it contrasts neatly with the better-known term cosmic dualism.</p><p>The Israelites are commonly credited with inventing the notion of cosmic monism and with ascribing to Yahweh the promise to reward Israel if she follows the commandments and to punish her if she does not. The notion of individual reward and punishment arises only late in the biblical period so it&apos;s important to understand the Mosaic covenant as corporate. To illustrate, in the third Commandment, Yahweh says that punishment for failure to keep the commandments may not always be immediate but may strike the third or even fourth generation.</p><p>The difficulty with cosmic monism in many real-world situations, including that of the Israelites following the ascendance of the Selucids in 200 BCE, is that there appear to be many instances, corporate and individual, where righteous behavior is not rewarded and wicked behavior is not punished, even four generations down the line.</p>",

    "Common Judaism": "Following the return from exile, leaders with contrasting views become prominent and by 200 BCE these differences of opinion led to the formation of several sects within Judaism. Within this shifting context, it’s important to remember that all Jews in late Second Temple Judaism held to a common set of beliefs and practices denoted by scholars as <b>Common Judaism</b>: 1) cosmic monism (there was only one god and those worshiped by others were a figment of their imaginations; they would eventually come to worship YHWH) and the corollary of aniconic worship (without images); 2) the belief that God rewards obedience and punishes transgression; 3) observance of the Sabbath on which no work was done, increasingly by assembling in synagogues; 4) circumcision of male children; 5) observance of the food laws (esp. refraining from eating pork); 6) reverence for the law of Moses and the Torah, which became canonical by 200 BCE.",
    
    "Sectarian Judaism": "Accelerated by the conflicts which followed the Maccabean Revolt (167 BCE), when the Hasmonean victors consolidated the offices of king and high priest (ignoring the tradition that the high priest was a descendant of Zadok, the first High Priest of Solomon’s Temple), <b>Sectarian Judaism</b> came to consist of several groups: 1) the Pharisees who preached the resurrection of the dead and the importance of the “oral Torah” revealed to Moses along with the written Torah; 2) the Sadducees who were mostly of the upper and priestly classes and controlled the cult of the Temple; 3) the Essenes who separated themselves from society living a communal life of asceticism, voluntary poverty and strict observance in numerous locations (the Qumran community of the Dead Sea Scrolls is often considered founded by Essenes); 4) “Enochic” Jews who, like the Qumran community, rejected the Temple administration as impure and anticipated an imminent end-of-days; and 5) the Zealots (or “fourth philosophy”), and the related Sicarii (dagger-men”), insurgents who wished to overthrow Roman rule by force. In the early second century BCE, we can also identify the Hellenizers, Jews who found it convenient to adopt Greek culture and collaborated with the Selucid rulers prior to the Maccabean Revolt.",
    
    "Rabbinic Judaism": "<b>Rabbinic Judaism</b> is the name given to the reinvention of Judaism following the destruction of the Second Temple by a group of rabbis heavily influenced by Pharisaic traditions, such as the oral law.  As they decried their inability to continue the cultic practices at the Temple, they focused on the correct interpretation of the Torah shifting from oral transmission to a written form (the Mishnah, codified about 200 CE, and the later Babylonian Talmud, 500 CE).",
    
    "Christianities": "In the period following Jesus’s crucifixion, many groups with wildly different theologies came to consider him the bearer of divine guidance.  Of these second century <b>Christianities</b>, Gnosticism and Marcionism were the largest and are considered separately.  Other groups deviated from the eventually-victorious “proto-orthodox” in various ways, many of them revolving around Christology: what was the exact nature of Jesus.  Docetists (docetism) held that as a divine son of God Jesus was only apparently human; an important corollary was that Jesus did not suffer on the Cross. A more nuanced version of docetism is called “adoptionism” in which Jesus was human but when adopted by God at his baptism became the Christ with divine powers (e.g., healing); this transformation was reversed on the Cross when Jesus said “Father, why do you forsake me?” Arianism (from Arius of Alexandria, 256-336) held, in opposition to the Gospel of John and the soon-to-prevail doctrine of the Trinity, that the Son of God was created (cf. “In the beginning was the Logos”, John 1:1) and distinct from God the Father (“the Father is greater than I”, John 14:28). Of course, all these non-trinitarian views were declared heretical.",
    
    "Orthodoxy": "The theology which became Christian <b>Orthodoxy</b> was finally settled at the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE: the Son was co-eternal with the Father having been “begotten, not made” from His same substance (consubstantial); the Holy Spirit had never been controversial.",
    
    "Gnosticism": "<b>Gnosticism</b> is a category and does not refer to a single group or theology. It focuses on the widespread belief that the world was made by a fallen, evil God but that nonetheless <i>the elect</i> among men retained an interior divine spark which yearned to return to the good spiritual world.  This could be achieved only by applying “secret knowledge” which had been made available by the divine Jesus (i.e., most gnostics were in that sense Christians).  The gnostic insistence that the material world was evil and stood in the way of spiritual salvation reinforced the similar views of the neo-Platonist theologians. To the extent that the battles over which views would become orthodox were influenced by the number of believers, the very large number of gnostics may have been influential.",
    
    "Marcionism": "<b>Marcionism</b>, from the second century Marcion of Sinope who preached in Rome, holds that the Hebrew God was an inferior, wrathful, and rather evil God (in part because he created this defective world) while the God of the New Testament was a loving, good God.  Accordingly, the Hebrew Bible was not considered part of the Marcionite canon which consisted of a redacted Luke (the parts reflecting favorably on the Hebrew Bible being omitted) and ten of the letters of Paul, who alone had understood Jesus’s message.",
    
    "Qumran": "<b>Qumran</b>, a location on the southwestern shore of the Dead Sea, is the designation usually given to the separatist sect of Jews who lived there and left behind the Dead Sea Scrolls.  They were intent on following strictly the law of Moses and focussed more than others on the concept of purity.  They had demanding initiation procedures, held all property in common, considered the administration of the Temple hopelessly corrupt, and had the most clearly articulated apocalyptic views (the expected two messiahs, a military leader and a priestly leader).",
