  "headerText": "<p>In Hebrew editions, the Hebrew Bible contains 24 books in three sections; the English translation in the <i>Jewish Study Bible</i> follows this organization. Note that the three books which are divided into two parts are nonetheless each counted as one book. (In the Protestant <i>Old Testament</i>, the same material is reorganized into 39 books: the divided books are counted as two, the minor prophets become twelve books, and Ezra & Nehemiah are separated.)</p><p>In this graphic, the units on the x axis are pages in the Jewish Study Bible so the width of each book is proportional to its length.  You can see that The Prophets are almost twice as long as the Torah while The Writings are just a quarter longer.</p><p>Clicking on any of the sections will take you to a graphic depicting its contents.</p>",
